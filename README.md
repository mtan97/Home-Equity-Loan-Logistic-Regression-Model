Code written by Michael Tan.

Data set is private. Code is open to showcase abilities in Python to clean data, train model, and interpret results.

Home equity loans are lines of credit banks offer to customers. Customers are expected to make monthly interest payments. If customers do not make a payment, they are considered delinquent, represented by binary 0(nondelinquent) or 1(delinquent). 

Model variables are loan level, unique to each customer. Model does not use macroeconomic variables like unemployment rate, or property price indexes.
